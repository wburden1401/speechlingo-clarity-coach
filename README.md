- Analyzes filler words, pacing, tone, WPM
- Generates professional feedback and suggestions using GPT
- Tailored per speaking prompt

Tech:
- React + TypeScript
- Node.js + Express backend
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 + Whisper
- Supabase (storage + backend)
- Azure pronunciation scoring (experimental)

Usage
1. Clone repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
